The provided blog post discusses the evolving cybersecurity landscape in 2025, focusing on AI threats, quantum computing, and defense strategies. Most of the claims regarding the general trends, capabilities of AI in cyberattacks, the existence of ransomware-as-a-service, critical infrastructure vulnerabilities, the quantum threat, the cybersecurity skills gap, and regulatory pressures are well-supported by current cybersecurity research and expert consensus. Predictive claims about the exact state in 2025 are inherently difficult to verify with 100% certainty but are presented as logical extensions of current trends. The claim about 'thousands of cyberattacks' occurring in the time it takes to read a sentence is an illustrative exaggeration, though the volume of attacks is indeed very high. The NIST's role in standardizing Post-Quantum Cryptography is accurate and ongoing.
