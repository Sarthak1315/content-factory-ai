The fact-checking process involved verifying 14 factual claims made in the provided blog post. The majority of claims, particularly those related to statistics, specific cyberattack details, and the nature of cybercrime tools, were found to be highly accurate and supported by multiple credible sources. Claims regarding the sophistication of AI in cyberattacks and the increasing demands of cyber insurance were also well-supported. Two claims, one about a specific average ransom demand figure and another about a future prediction, received lower confidence scores due to the difficulty of precise verification for current averages or the inherent speculative nature of future events.
